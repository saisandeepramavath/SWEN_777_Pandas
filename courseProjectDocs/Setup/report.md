## Test Suite Summary

### Test Categories Executed

#### 1. Unit Tests
Our baseline testing focused on core pandas functionality with the following categories:

**Series Constructor Tests (`pandas/tests/series/test_constructors.py`)**
- Series creation from various data types (lists, dicts, arrays)
- Index handling and data type specifications
- Constructor parameter validation
- Memory and performance optimizations

**DataFrame Constructor Tests (`pandas/tests/frame/test_constructors.py`)**
- DataFrame creation from dictionaries, lists, and other structures
- Column and index specification
- Multi-dimensional data handling
- Constructor edge cases and validation

**Numerical Operations Tests (`pandas/tests/test_nanops.py`)**
- Mathematical operations (sum, mean, std, var)
- Statistical functions (skew, kurtosis, quantiles)
- Missing value handling in calculations
- Numerical precision and overflow handling

**Data Cleaning Tests (`pandas/tests/series/methods/test_dropna.py`, `pandas/tests/frame/methods/test_dropna.py`)**
- Missing value detection and removal
- NA/NaN handling strategies
- Data validation and cleaning operations

#### 2. Integration Tests
Limited integration testing was performed as part of the constructor and method tests, ensuring components work together correctly.

#### 3. System Tests
Not applicable for this baseline - pandas is a library, not a standalone system.

#### 4. UI Tests
Not applicable - pandas is a data processing library without a user interface.
